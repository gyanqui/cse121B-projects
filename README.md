## CSE-121B JavaScript Projects

Welcome to the CSE-121B JavaScript Algorithms Repository! This repository contains my coursework, assignments, and projects for the CSE-121B course, where we explore the principles of programming using JavaScript to solve problems specific to my major discipline. The goal of this repository is to showcase my understanding and proficiency in JavaScript programming and algorithm design.

## Course Overview

CSE-121B is an advanced course building upon the principles of programming learned in CSE 110 and 111. Throughout this course, we will learn how to translate simple, discipline-specific algorithms into JavaScript, create functions from well-defined descriptions, and use JavaScript-specific syntax and style. We will also set up and become familiar with the development environment for JavaScript, including Visual Studio Code, which will be our primary code editor.
